> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.  
â€• _Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry_

I really like this quote because it reflects one oy my beliefs in software programming that I developed over the years; Building software that can easily be understood by fellow software engineers.  
Having spent a lot of time pounding my head in agony trying to understand (legacy) code, I have come to the conclusion that I thrive to not be the cause of someone else's headache ðŸ˜‰

#### Who I am
---
I have been doing software development for over 35 years now. Ranging from some disgraceful Assembler code hacking on home computers to ai-assisted microservice coding for the cloud.  

In most recent years I have been expanding my playing from pure coding to cover the whole software development lifecycle, from refining requirements to definition of continuous deployment pipelines.  

I am also a huge fan of agile software development. Since I not only see it as the best way to produce tangible results that actually benefit the customer, but also as the best way of collaborating and working together as a team.

#### What I'm doing
---
Currently I am working as a software developer on the migrating of legacy systems to [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Which includes:
* Redesigning these systems to a cloud native architecture (where possible)
* Shifting deployment to [GitOps with flux](https://fluxcd.io/)
* Definition of GitLab pipelines for Continuous deployment
* configuring various [CNCF projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) like [helm](https://www.cncf.io/projects/helm/), [flux](https://www.cncf.io/projects/flux/) or [keda](https://www.cncf.io/projects/keda/).


#### What I've done (and witnessed)
---
It's interesting that in hindsight, the things I remember most are the things that were not really the shinning examples of software development.
So please take the following list withe the appropriate grain of salt:
* Defining [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) systems and BPEL workflows using [ESBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus) with such fine-sounding names like [Talend](https://www.talend.com/resources/how-an-esb-simplifies-application-integration/) or [webMethods](https://www.softwareag.com/) that would push the [xml parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Xerces) to a new, unprecedented level.
* Carefully gardening [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) Monoliths to sizes in all dimensions where no application had gone before.
* Having to witness dozens of pitiful developers being tortured by having to code SQL statements for hundreds of [JEE Entity Beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans) with [bean managed persistence](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/enterprise-javabeans-second/1565928695/ch06s02.html).
* Bringing down whole clusters of banking servers by rather unconventional exception handling in a [static initialization block](https://www.baeldung.com/java-initialization#2-static-initialization-block).
* Witnessing probably the biggest online [bond trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market) in 2000, using a [Java Applet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet).
* Consulting french customers on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX) and [Databases](https://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/hp/9000_hpux/1991-200x/199709_36389-90016_Up_and_Running_with_ALLBASE_SQL.pdf) in such annoying french that these poor people voluntarily talked german.
