> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.  
â€• _Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry_

I really like this quote because it reflects one oy my beliefs in software programming that I developed over the years; Building software that can easily be understood by fellow software engineers.  
Having spent a lot of time pounding my head in agony trying to understand (legacy) code, I have come to the conclusion that I thrive to not be the cause of someone else's headache ðŸ˜‰

#### Who I am
---
I have been doing software development for over 35 years now. Ranging from some disgraceful Assembler code hacking on home computers to ai-assisted microservice coding for the cloud.  

In most recent years I have been expanding my playing from pure coding to cover the whole software development lifecycle, from refining requirements to definition of continuous deployment pipelines.  

I am also a huge fan of agile software development. Since I not only see it as the best way to produce tangible results that actually benefit the customer, but also as the best way of collaborating and working together as a team.

#### What I'm doing
---
Currently I am working as a software developer on the migrating of legacy systems to [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Which includes:
* Redesigning these systems to a cloud native architecture (where possible)
* Shifting deployment to [GitOps with flux](https://fluxcd.io/)
* Definition of GitLab pipelines for Continuous deployment
* configuring various [CNCF projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) like [helm](https://www.cncf.io/projects/helm/), [flux](https://www.cncf.io/projects/flux/) or [keda](https://www.cncf.io/projects/keda/).


#### What I've done
---
Here is a short, not complete, list of the good and not so brilliant things I did, from present to past (pun intended):
* TBD
* Carefully gardening Spring Boot Monoliths to size where no application has gone before
